# School21 Piscine

## About

Solutions for School21 ([School42](https://42.fr/en/homepage/) franchise from France) introduction course called [Piscine](https://42.fr/en/admissions/42-piscine/) which means “Swimming pool” in French. This course includes a full month of C programming and peer-to-peer interactions. But in fact, it’s just a preparation for a long and comprehensive educational process in School42.

In June 2021 I challenge myself to pass this course even though I already had 10+ years of background in IT. The goal was to check School42 methodology from the inside, revise my forgotten knowledge of the C programming language and just have fun. I finished this Piscine by becoming the first student in our local campus (in Kazan) who pass all exams with 100% scores.

## Current status

All solutions are provided as-is without any guarantees. This code was written on campus under the pressure of a tight schedule. But for most of the modules, I am really proud.

Please keep in mind, that solutions are not 100% complete. Some of the tasks actually failed unit test checks.

## How to use

Most of the modules include tests - they are required not only to check your code but also to do peer-to-peer reviews. These tests contain executable shell files which compile the solution along with test code and run it. Output depends on the task, but usually, it says if the solution passes tests or not.

## Used technologies
